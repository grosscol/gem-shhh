# Gem Shhh

Bah to your changelog, your party rules, your entirely superfluous
description of the gem I already decided to install.

Gem Shhh turns off obnoxious and useless post install messages,
which happens to be all of them.

## Installation

    $ gem install gem-shhh

## Usage

    $ gem install httparty
    Successfully installed httparty-0.13.3
    1 gem installed
